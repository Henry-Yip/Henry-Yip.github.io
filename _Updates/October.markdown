Sorry haven't updated this page for a while... These are the things I did in October!

1. I have tried to redirect my page to the "splash page" instead, which took me at least 3 hours. 

{% highlight ruby %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML Meta Tag</title>
      <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "0; url = https://henry-yip.github.io/Splash/" />
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Redirecting to my Home Page</p>
   </body>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

It turns out the solution is quite easy...


2. I updated my page on Classical Mechanics, and added Lagrangian Dynamics (Under HKDSE Physics). It makes more sense and makes my previous session of dynamics coherent with hkdse symmablus , and the formula is quite more appreciable. 

While doing this page I was wondering why this isn't (I assume not!) taught in HKPhO syllabus because I think it would be really neat, and partial derivatives aren't hard to learn at all.


3. I reordered my physics page a bit, as I want to include this in my CV. I also added Allison Lau's CS notes, thanks for that!

As November approaches I will have less time to update this website... Such a shame!
