#1: New Post on [Dirichlet's Kernel]({% link _Physics/2023-02-24-Dirichlet.markdown %})

Date: 26/2/2023

#2: Dealing with [Cookiebots](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=high-priority-bundle-brand&utm_device=c&utm_term=cookiebot&utm_content=high-prio-brand&matchtype=e&msclkid=fd2ab707084e15f871fdd4fdae5db49a)

According to [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation), I need to include a consent form while using cookies, but according to some online tests my consent form is insufficient (*i.e.* still not complying with law)

All content below is from [this website](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/gdpr/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=high-priority-bundle-brand&utm_device=c&utm_term=cookiebot&utm_content=high-prio-brand)

```bash
If personal data is being sent to organizations or jurisdictions beyond the reach of the GDPR or that are not deemed ‘adequate’ by the GDPR, one must inform the user specifically about this and the risks involved.  
```

```bash
All consents must be recorded as evidence that consent has been given.
```

If you are making a website make note of this:

```bash
The EDPB guidelines make it clear that scrolling or continued browsing on a website does not constitute valid consent and that cookie banners are not allowed to have pre-ticked checkboxes.
```

So basically my website is not good enough in "protecting visitors' safety". I have realized a lot of Jekyll Generated websites don't really have these, but I believe my website is unique as it as so many "third-party cookies" like embedded puzzles from chess.com, $$\KaTeX$$, Polls etc, and I think it's better to follow the law, anyways.

#3 $$\KaTeX$$ being recognised as cookie
So basically if the visitors say "no" to my cookies (which is very reasonable), they cannot view my math equations. This is very annoying. I don't believe $$\KaTeX$$ is really a cookie, but it's third-party so maybe I'm wrong

```bash
Thank you for making this far! This is my 11th month working on this website!
```
