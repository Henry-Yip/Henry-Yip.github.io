#1: Major Error Fix

 - Problem: Some posts in "Journal" don't show up. 
 - Indentification and Solution: I've found out some unnecessary **HTML** files that may have "masked" my **Markdown** files. These files seem to come from _sites, and it may be a result of moving files around carelessly. Therefore I have deleted all these files.
 - Further Prevention of Problem: Potentially deleting _sites permeanantly? As for how to do this I will further investigate
