My name is Henry Yip, a Year 3 Mathematical Physics Student at the University of Edinburgh.

This is [My Personal CV ]({{site.url}}/assets/Henry-Yip-CV.pdf)

I am interested in Classical Mechanics and Differential Geometry, and I will do a supervised funded summer research on 3-body problem (in Classical Mechanics) this summer.

I am a course representative for Mathematical Physics, so if you are studying physics in Edinburgh and have opinions over anything, feel free to send me a email and I will mention it in SSLC meetings.
