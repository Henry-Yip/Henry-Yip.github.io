## Introduction
Algolia Search is one of the best ways to enable searching in your Jekyll Website. For Windows users, all you need to do is to have a usuable Algolia account, cd into your directory and type:

```bash
set ALGOLIA_API_KEY=(Your ALGOLIA_API_KEY) && bundle exec jekyll algolia
```

and then edit your config_yaml, gemfile and home.html as seen in the official documentation (or whatever you want it to call. Technically this is not my home page. But remember to set the layout of this page as the layout that contains algolia.html). Anyways enjoy the result!

## Minimal Mistakes
Please Check [This](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#algolia). The content below is directly quoted from there

Quoting from that website, basically you need to:
1. Add the jekyll-algolia gem to your Gemfile, in the **:jekyll_plugins** section.
 ```bash
 group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
  gem "jekyll-paginate"
  gem "jekyll-include-cache"
  gem "jekyll-algolia"
 end
 ```
      

2. bundle install
3. Switch search providers from lunr to algolia in your _config.yml file:
4. Add the following Algolia credentials to your _config.yml file:
 ```bash
 algolia:
  application_id: # YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
  index_name: # YOUR_INDEX_NAME
  search_only_api_key: # YOUR_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY
  powered_by: # true (default), false
  ```
 
 
5. Finally, for Windows User run:
 ```bash
 set ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key
bundle exec jekyll algolia
 ```
