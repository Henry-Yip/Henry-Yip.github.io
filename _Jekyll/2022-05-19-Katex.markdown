Please note that this method is targeted for Minima users. Minima is the best Jekyll Theme for beginners as it is the easiest to navigate. I will make a separate tutorial for Minimal Mistakes users!

### How to include Math Symbols in Jekyll
Note that in this website, we use $$\KaTeX$$ instead of $$\LaTeX$$. 

For $$\LaTeX$$ users you may ask: What is $$\KaTeX$$? Don't expect me to put everything here, search online for more!
{: .notice--warning}

Like [HERE](https://katex.org/)
{: .notice--warning}



If you want to use $$\KaTeX$$ in Jekyll, you first need to copy the **_layouts** and **_includes** files in [GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Afterwards, you need to include the necessary gems. Please refer to my Gemfile:

```bash
source "https://rubygems.org"


gem "minima"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
  gem 'kramdown-parser-gfm'
  gem "sprockets", "~> 3.7" 
  gem 'jekyll-remote-theme'
  gem 'jekyll-feed'
  gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?
end

gem 'duktape'
gem 'katex'
gem 'execjs'
gem 'kramdown-math-katex' 

gem "webrick"

gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
```
And afterwards you need to include the [starter template](https://katex.org/docs/browser.html) in your custom-head.html in _includes. Just like this:
```bash
{% comment %}
  Placeholder to allow defining custom head, in principle, you can add anything here, e.g. favicons:

  1. Head over to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to add your own favicons.
  2. Customize default _includes/custom-head.html in your source directory and insert the given code snippet.
{% endcomment %}
<!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, KaTeX may not render properly -->
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.3/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-KiWOvVjnN8qwAZbuQyWDIbfCLFhLXNETzBQjA/92pIowpC0d2O3nppDGQVgwd2nB" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <!-- The loading of KaTeX is deferred to speed up page rendering -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.3/dist/katex.min.js" integrity="sha384-0fdwu/T/EQMsQlrHCCHoH10pkPLlKA1jL5dFyUOvB3lfeT2540/2g6YgSi2BL14p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    <!-- To automatically render math in text elements, include the auto-render extension: -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.3/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js" integrity="sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR" crossorigin="anonymous"
        onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```
### Why it works?
How it works is that **head.html** has a line:
```bash 
include custom-head.html
```

So the content in **custom-head.html** is included in **head.html**. This content is included in **default.html** as it has a line called:

```bash
include head.html 
```
Which is included in **post.html** as it contains **default.html**. We have stated in the front matter:

```bash

layout: post
title: Jekyll and KaTeX
katex: True

```
And therefore $$\KaTeX$$ is included in this page!
