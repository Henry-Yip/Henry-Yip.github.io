## Why Jekyll
There are **many ways** to create a website. Most people stick with "Website Builder" tools like [wix](https://www.wix.com/), the major benefit being [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). It is also relatively easier to build as you don't need to work with command prompt and debug. However, for people using GitHub and are interesting in computing, since jekyll supports Github Pages, it is always almost recommended to use Jekyll.

This comparision is similar to $$\LaTeX$$ vs **Word**. It is easier to work with word, but mathematicians may pick on you if you use word for your thesis!
