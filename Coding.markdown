I made these quite a long time ago... Obviously a lot of them are **extremely** flawed... (such as the prime checker!) There are obviously much better ways to check primality, which results in psuedoprimes...

According to [mathworld.wolfram.com](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimalityTest.html#:~:text=Numbers%20that%20have%20passed%20%20a%20probabilistic%20prime,in%20fact%20composite%20is%20known%20as%20a%20pseudoprime.):

"A number that passes a probabilistic test but is in fact composite is known as a pseudoprime. There are many specific types of pseudoprimes, the most common being the Fermat pseudoprimes, which are composites that nonetheless satisfy Fermat's little theorem."
