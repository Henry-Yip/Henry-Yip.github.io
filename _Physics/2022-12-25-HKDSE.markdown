## Introduction
HKDSE is a public exam taken by Hong Kong high school students. It covers a wide range of physics (basic dynamics, gas, electromagnetism, etc.)

I am here using knowledge I gained in university to explain some advanced topics strongly related to the HKDSE Physics syllabus. 

# Part I:
The part covers orbits and gravitational forces

## Centripetal Force
From HKDSE Physics, we have Centripetal force as $$mr\omega^2$$, or equivalently $$mr \dot{\theta}^2$$ This is a very special form and only works for circular orbit, as radius is a constant. In General,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{F}=\left(\ddot{r}-r \dot{\theta}^2\right) \hat{r}+(2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}+r \ddot{\theta}) \hat{\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Kepler's Third Law
We can easily deduce Kepler's Third Law below:

$$
\begin{align}
F=mr \omega^2 &= \frac{GMm}{r^2} \\
 \omega^2 &= \frac{GM}{r^3} \\
 \left (\frac{2 \pi}{T} \right)^2 &=\frac{GM}{r^3} \\
  \left (\frac{4 {\pi}^2}{T^2} \right) &=\frac{GM}{r^3} \\
  T^2&=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3  \space \space \blacksquare
\end{align}
$$


Which is Kepler's third law (in circular motion).

### Example 1

Consider Geostationary Satellites. It takes $$24 \text{ hours} =1440\text{ minutes}=86400 \text{ seconds}$$ for a complete revolution, hence $$T=86400 \text{s}$$. Applying the formula we have $$r^3=\frac{GMT^2} {4\pi^2}$$. Hence $$r=(4.22 \times 10^7)  \text{ m}$$, meaning radius of orbit of geostationary satellite is around $$42200\text{ km}$$ from center of earth! 

Its velocity is: $$v= r \omega= 3070  ms^{-1}$$

Estimate Peter Griffin's weight:

With $$T=2.75s$$ and $$r=1m$$, we have $$M=7.82 \times 10^{10} \text{kg} $$. Hmmmm


### Generalized Case
Unfortunately the case above only works for circles. Below I will show it works for all ellispes. For what ellispes are, please check [Appendix E]

**Proposition**: $$T^2 \propto a^3 \space \forall $$ ellipses, where a is the semi-major axis

**Proof**:

First Note **Kepler's Second Law**, the rate at which the area is swept by the **Radius Vector** (surprising a constant!)

$$
\dot{A}=\frac{d A}{d t}=\frac{r(r d \theta) / 2}{d t}=\frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}=\frac{h}{2}
$$

Next, by substitution and using the results from [Appendix A]


$$
\Delta t=\frac{A}{\dot{A}}=\frac{\pi a b}{h / 2}=\frac{2 \pi a b}{h}
$$

Next, I'll state the formulae below without proof. Remember that $$\epsilon$$ is defined by us so the below are *almost* definitions

$$
a=\frac{l}{1-\epsilon^2}, \quad b=a \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}=\frac{l}{\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}}
$$

Using $$l=\frac{mh^2}{k}$$, we have:

$$
\Delta t=\frac{2 \pi a b}{h}=\frac{2 \pi}{h} a^2 \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad(\Delta t)^2=\frac{(2 \pi)^2 a^3}{h^2} l=(2 \pi)^2 a^3 \frac{m}{k}
$$

We deduce $$(\Delta t)^2 / a^3=(2 \pi)^2 / G M$$, which is consistent with the analysis from **HKDSE**

## Orbit Equation:

We are trying to find what happens if we disturb a orbiting physical system:

Using the knowledge from [Appendix B]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %}), we can quite easily deduce the orbit equation:

$$
\ddot{r}-\frac{h^2}{r^3}=\frac{F_r(r)}{m} 
$$

I'll leave this as an exercise for the reader. 

```bash
Hint 1: We're dealing with Central Force, only radial force matters
```
```bash
Hint 2: Use Newton's Second Law
```

I enjoy the physics of small perbuations, especially in classical mechanics. 
First, assume a small perbuation around a circle with radius $$a$$ *i.e.* $$r(t)=a+\rho(t)$$ with $$\rho(0) \ll a$$. substitute into our orbit equation we have:

$$
\ddot{\rho}-\frac{h^2}{(a+\rho)^3}=\frac{F_r(a+\rho)}{m} 
$$

Here we'll use binomial expansion for negative coefficients. For more details view the wikipedia page for [Negative Binomial Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution)

However there's a nice trick by differentiating the taylor series.

$$
\ddot{\rho}-\frac{h^2}{a^3}\left(1-3 \frac{\rho}{a}\right)=\frac{F_r(a)}{m}+\frac{d F_r(a)}{d r} \frac{\rho}{m} 
$$

Further rearranging will get you: 

$$
\ddot{\rho}+\left[\frac{3 h^2}{a^4}-\frac{1}{m} \frac{d F_r(a)}{d r}\right] \rho=0 
$$

```bash
Right-Hand-Side surprisingly reduces to 0, can you spot why?
```

I don't know if you have done **Differential Equations** before. Above describes a simple harmonic oscillator with period $$\omega$$, in the form of $$\ddot{\rho}+{\omega}^2 \rho=0$$. Now we'll ensure $$\omega^2>0$$, *s.t.* $$\omega$$ is real, *i.e.*

$$
\frac{3 h^2}{a^4}-\frac{1}{m} \frac{d F_r(a)}{d r}>0
$$

Hence if the above stands we have:

$$
\omega^2 \equiv \frac{3 h^2}{a^4}-\frac{1}{m} \frac{d F_r(a)}{d r}
$$

This describes a simple harmonic motion with $$\rho(t)=A \cos (\omega t+\phi)$$.

It will look like this:

We have used simple math to analyse the orbit equation! How cool is that!


## Eccentricity and Energy

From Wikipedia, we can obtain:
$$r(\theta)=\frac{L^2}{m^2 \mu} \frac{1}{1+e \cos \theta}$$

The symbols are different from what we have defined. So we will fix this. $$L$$ in wikipedia is defined as $$mr^2\dot{\theta}$$, which is equal to $$mh$$ (see appendix). Hence $$L^2=m^2h^2$$. Then we have:

$$r(\theta)=\frac{h^2}{\mu} \frac{1}{1+e \cos \theta}$$

As $$\mu$$ is the constant for which $$\frac{\mu}{r^2}$$ equals the acceleration of the smaller body, $$\mu=\frac{k}{m}$$. Hence:

$$r(\theta)=\frac{mh^2}{k} \frac{1}{1+e \cos \theta}$$
knowing $$E=T+V$$, where $$T$$ is kinetic energy and $$V$$ is potential energy, we can deduce:
$$E=\frac{m}{2}\left(\dot{r}^2+\frac{h^2}{r^2}\right)-\frac{k}{r}$$
After that it's just some annoying algebraic manipulations. We will get:
$$
E=\frac{mh^2}{2l^2}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right]
$$

From this website, we can see:

$$
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{G^2m^3M^2}{2L^2}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right] 
\end{equation}
$$

We will compare it with our equation: 
 $$l=\frac{mh^2}{k}=\frac{L^2}{mk}$$, so $$l^2=\frac{L^4}{m^2k^2}$$

$$
E=\frac{m^3h^2k^2}{2L^4}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right]
$$

As $$k=GMm$$, $$k^2=G^2M^2m^2$$. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
E&=\frac{m^3h^2 G^2M^2m^2}{2L^4}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right] \\
&= \frac{m^3h^2 G^2M^2m^2}{2(L^2)(m^2h^2)}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right] \\
&= \frac{m^3 G^2M^2}{2L^2}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right] \\
&= \frac{G^2m^3M^2}{2L^2}\left[\epsilon^2-1\right] 
&\blacksquare
\end{aligned}
$$

It is important to note that the eccentricity of a circle is $$0$$ and that of a parabola is $$1$$. When $$E=0$$, it simply means the magnitude of kinetic energy and magnitude of potential energy are the same


# Part II
Part II deals with Statics and Dynamics, i.e. objects that moves

## (Angular)Momentum Conservation

From [Appendix B]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %}) , we deduced that
$$r^2 \dot{\theta} \equiv h=\frac{|\underline{L}|}{m}$$, or equivalently $$|\underline{L}|=mr^2 \dot{\theta}$$ Combining the fact that $$v=r\dot{\theta}$$ we have $$|\underline{L}|=mrv$$

Angular Momentum is something you will encounter while skating (or spinning your chair). If you spread your arms and contract your arms, you will realize that you will spin in a different speed, because angular momentum has to be conserved (assumed no friction)

Compared to $$p=mv$$ in HKDSE this rings a bell. However, it is always incorrect to say "angular momentum is converted to linear momentum" because this violates dimensional analysis. More about Dimensional Analysis in [Appendix C]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %})

## Air Resistance (Turbulent flow)

Inspired by a conversation in Shenzhen, I am trying to compare the terminal velocity of a human and a plane under turbulent flow:

Consider $$a=\dot{v(t)}$$, we have $$F=m\dot{v}$$. Now consider downwards as positive. Assume air resistance is $$kv^2$$, where $$k \in \mathbb{R}$$. Then we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 m\dot{v}&=mg-kv^2 \\
 m \frac{dv}{dt}&=mg-kv^2 \\
 mdv&=(mg-kv^2)dt \\
 \frac{mdv}{mg-kv^2}&=dt \\
\int_{0}^{v}  \frac{mdv}{mg-kv^2} &= \int_{0}^{t}dt \\
t&=\int_{0}^{v}  \frac{mdv}{mg-kv^2} 
 \end{aligned}
 $$

 Where we assumed $$v(0)=0$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\int \frac{d v}{m g-k v^2}  =\frac{1}{m g} \int\frac{d v}{1-\frac{k}{m g} v^2} \\
\end{equation}
$$

Evaluate the indefinite integral first, If we assume $$u=\sqrt\frac{k}{mg} v$$, hence $$\sqrt\frac{mg}{k} du=dv$$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{1}{\sqrt{m g k}} \int \frac{d u}{1-u^2} \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{m g k}} 
\tanh ^{-1}(u) \\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m g k}} \tanh ^{-1}\left(v \sqrt{\frac{k}{m g}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The reader can easily check that the definite integral is the same, i.e.

$$t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m g k}} \tanh ^{-1}\left(v \sqrt{\frac{k}{m g}}\right)$$

After this we can do some algebraic manipulations to get :
\begin{equation}
v=\sqrt {\frac{mg}{k}}\tanh[(\sqrt{mgk})(t)] 
\end{equation}

As $$\tanh(x)$$ approaches $$1$$, $$v_\text{Terminal}=\sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}}$$

Next, we have to find the value of $$k$$:
Using [drag equation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_equation), assuming turbulent flow:

$$
 F_{\mathrm{d}}=\frac{1}{2} \rho  c_{\mathrm{d}} A v^2
$$
Hence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_\text{Terminal}&=\sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} \\
&=\sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho c_d A}}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $$m_\text{human}$$<<<$$m_\text{plane}$$, the difference in $$c_d$$ and $$A$$ can't compensate, and hence terminal velocity of planes are much higher during free fall.
