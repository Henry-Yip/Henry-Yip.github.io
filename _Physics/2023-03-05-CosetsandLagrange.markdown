## Cosets

## Theorem 

Claim: $$g_1H=g_2H$$ is *possible* even when $$g_1 \neq g_2$$

Proof: Consider a subgroup of $$S_3$$ that only contains the rotations and the identity element $$e$$. From above, this subgroup contains $$(n-1)+1=n$$ elements , so the subgroup, denoted by $$H$$, has $$3$$ elements, *i.e.*   $$e, (123),(132)$$. Now consider $$(12) \in S_3$$:

$$
\begin{align}
(12)(H)&=(12),(12)(123),(12)(132) \\
&=(12),(23),(13)
\end{align}
$$

Now consider $$(23) \in S_3$$:
$$
\begin{align}
(23)(H)&=(23),(23)(123),(23)(132) \\
&=(23),(13),(12) \\
&=(12),(23),(13) \\
&=(12)(H)
\end{align}
$$

Physical interpretation: It works for the rotation group of $$S_3$$ because of symmetry, *i.e.* $$1,2,3$$ can be relabelled between themselves freely as long as the relabelling itself is bijective

This shows that $$g_1H=g_2H$$ is *possible* even when $$g_1 \neq g_2$$ . The function $$f: G \rightarrow G$$ s.t. $$g_n \rightarrow hg_n$$ for any $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ is not *injective* as 
$$(f(g_1)=f(g_2)) \nrightarrow (g_1=g_2)$$ 
$$\blacksquare$$

Surprising Theorem:
$$\forall h \in H, hH=H$$

Idea of proof: From set theory if $$hH \subseteq H$$ and $$H \subseteq hH$$ then $$hH=H$$.

$$hH\subseteq H$$ is obvious from group axioms (closure). I'll prove $$H \subseteq hH$$. To prove that I'll need to show $$y \in H \rightarrow y \in hH$$.

Working backwards, we want $$h^{-1}y \in H$$,  This can easily be proven true: If $$h \in H$$ then $$h^{-1} \in H$$ by group axioms (inverse). Then if $$y \in H$$ and $$h^{-1} \in H$$, $$h^{-1}y \in H$$ by group axioms (closure).

More formal approach:
Pick $$y \in H$$. Since $$h \in H$$, $$h^{-1} \in H$$ by inverse axiom of groups, hence $$h^{-1}y \in H$$ by closure property of groups. Denote $$m=h^{-1}y$$. As $$m \in H$$, $$hm \in hH$$, hence $$hh^{-1}y \in hH$$, *i.e.* $$y \in hH$$. Hence $$H \subseteq hH$$. 

As $$hH \subseteq H$$ and $$H \subseteq hH$$ then $$hH=H$$ $$\blacksquare$$

Example: As above, the rotation group of $$S_3$$ is a subgroup of $$S_3$$ (Left as an exercise for the readers). Pick $$h=(123)$$:

$$
\begin{align}
(123)(H)&=(123),(123)(123),(123)(132) \\
&=(123),(132),e \\
\end{align}
$$

From above, the rotation group is re-obtained. 









### Converse of Lagrange's Theorem??

 Converse of Lagrange's Theorem is not generally true , i.e. if $$d$$ is a divisor of the order of a group $$G$$, then there may not exist a subgroup $$H$$ where $$|H| = d$$
 
### Proof
An example: $$A_4$$ has order $$12$$ but doesn't have subgroups of order $$6$$.

The proof below is not original and comes from 
[here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/582658/a-4-has-no-subgroup-of-order-6)

Assume $$H < A_4$$ is a subgroup of $$A_4$$ of order 6 

Then, for any $$a \notin H$$, $$a H \cap H=\emptyset$$
Again,since all cosets have name number of elements,$$|a H|=|e H|=|H|$$ (all cosets have the same number of elements), this implies that $$|a H|=6$$. 

Then, as cosets form a partition of the group $$A_4$$, and $$\left|A_4\right|=12$$, then
$$
A_4=H \cup a H
$$

Now suppose that $$a$$ is a 3-cycle in $$A_4$$, then either $$a^2 \in H$$ or $$a^2 \in a H$$ (by **closure** if $$a \in A_4$$ then $$a^2 \in A_4$$)

If $$a^2 \in H$$, then this implies that $$a^4=a^2 \cdot a^2 \in H$$ (again, **closure**) However, since the order of $$a$$ is 3 (it is a 3-cycle), then $$a^4=a$$ and hence $$a 
\in H$$. However, from assumption $$a \notin H$$. Contradiction

Similarly, if $$a^2 \in a H$$ then $$a \in H$$ and again this is a contradiction.
Hence, $$H$$ cannot be a subgroup of $$A_4$$ of order 6 $$\blacksquare$$

We have assumed implicitly that $$A_4$$ is generated by 3-cycles: I won't proof that but I'll give an idea on why this might be true:

First, any product of two transpositions is a product of 3-cycles. 

As an example, consider the product of **two** transpositions:

$$(ab)(ac)=(acb)$$
$$(ab)(cd)=(dac)(abd)$$

**Hint**: Do the "inside" operation first, *e.g.* for the first one consider $$(ac)$$ then consider $$(ab)$$. In general, for $$(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$$

I'll do the first one as an example. 

To see where $$a$$ is mapped to, First consider $$(ac)$$, $$a \rightarrow c$$.  There is no $$c$$ in $$(ab)$$ so indeed $$a \rightarrow c$$.

To see where $$c$$ is mapped to, First consider $$c \rightarrow a$$ in $$(ac)$$. Notice that $$a \rightarrow b$$ in $$(ab)$$. So $$c \rightarrow b$$.

Finally for $$b$$, again, first consider $$(ac)$$. However, $$b$$ is not in $$(ac)$$. From $$(ab)$$, we can see $$b \rightarrow a$$. Thus, $$b \rightarrow a$$

Therefore,  $$a \rightarrow c \rightarrow b \rightarrow a$$,  *i.e.*  $$(ab)(ac)=(acb)$$ $$\blacksquare$$

I will state without proof that the product of a even number of transpositions is also a 3-cycle.
