## Ranking The STRONGEST Charged Moves in Pokemon Go by DPS

### Methodology
I considered some of the strongest known charged moves in Pokemon Go, such as Frenzy Plant, and changed their typings to Psychic. Then, I make Mega Mewtwo Y, the strongest pokemon of all time, to learn these moves and compare their DPS

## Results

### Commentary
 - $$\text{Aeroblast++}$$ is Clearly the **BEST** move
 - Origin Pulse is surprisingly weak, despite having one of the highest $$\text{DPS} \times \text{DPE}$$ scores
 - $$\text{Sacred fire++}$$ is surprisingly weak
 - $$\text{Aura Sphere}$$ and $$\text{Doom Desire}$$ are ridiculously strong

### Commentary
 - $$\text{Snarl}$$ is surprisingly the best by a *huge* margin
 - $$\text{Lock-On}$$ is only OP in **PvP**... At least it's still fairly strong in **PvE**, dealing more damage than **Confusion**
 - $$\text{Snarl (Psychic)}$$ paired with $$\text{Aeroblast++ (Psychic)}$$ deals 23.5% more damage than $$\text{Confusion}$$+$$\text{Psystrike}$$, which is ridiculous

  

## Future
I will gradually include all moves for fairness. Meanwhile check out my other two pages:
