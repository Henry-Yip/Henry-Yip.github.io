## Ranking Charged Moves in Pokemon Go by DPS

### Methodology
I considered some of the strongest known charged moves in Pokemon Go, such as Frenzy Plant, and changed their typings to Psychic. Then, I make Mega Mewtwo Y, the strongest pokemon of all time, to learn these moves and compare their DPS

## Results

### Commentary
 - Aeroblast++ is Clearly the **BEST** move
 - Origin Pulse is surprisingly weak, despite having one of the highest $$\text{DPS} \times \text{\DPE}$$ scores
 - Sacred fire++ is surprisingly weak
 - Aura Sphere and Doom Desire are ridiculously strong

## Future
I will gradually include all moves for fairness. Meanwhile check out my other two pages:

 - [PVP]({% link _Pokemon/2023-03-02-PVP.markdown %})
 - [PVP]({% link _Pokemon/2023-03-03-PVE.markdown %})

```bash
Have Fun~
