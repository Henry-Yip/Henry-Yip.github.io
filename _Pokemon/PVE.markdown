### Slaking Viability

Slaking is a Pokemon with **Great** Potential, having a 290 Attack stat, one of the highest among non-legendary/non-mega evolutions. Unfortunately, it has Yawn as fast move, the worst possible move, as it does 1 damage per time and has pitful energy gain. Also, as it is Normal Typed, which is a huge disadvantage as normal moves are not effective against anything. Even if it has charged moves of other types, the moves aren't boosted by STAB, reducing its viability. I am investigating on how slaking's viability can increase by changing its movepool.

### New Fast Move
We introduce Lock-On as the fast move, a move that doesn't do much damage itself but has a ridiculously high energy gain. 

### New Charged Move
We introduce an Ice Type move called Ice Blast. It has the same parameters as Aeroblast++, one of the strongest charged moves in the game. 

### Why Ice type?
 - Ice type is one of the weaker types in pokemon go
 - Ice type is quite useful in raids, as many strong pokemons are doubly weak to it, such as rayquaza, dragonite, etc

### Simulation Time
I use [This Website](https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet) for simulation
