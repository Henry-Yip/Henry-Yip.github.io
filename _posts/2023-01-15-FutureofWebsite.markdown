## Domain Name
Several People, like [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/) have asked me to buy a domain. However, I think [https://henry-yip.github.io/](https://henry-yip.github.io/) is a fabulous name and will lead people to my Github page, which is what I intended from beginning. 

## New Content
I must say I really enjoyed writing my blog post on [HKDSE Physics]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-HKDSE.markdown %})

I will focus more on Physics Content from now on, having attended course related to [Fields, Waves](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxphys08053.htm) and [Matter](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxphys08054.htm), which is heavily related to [HKDSE Physics]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-HKDSE.markdown %})

I plan to write more about Astrophysics. I have made a $$\LaTeX$$ [post]({% link _Physics/2022-05-21-Astrophysics.markdown %}) about it and I have included my $$\LaTeX$$ Source Code in [Another Post]({% link _Physics/2022-05-22-Astrocont.markdown %}). I have also written a semi-formal article on [Dark Energy]({% link _Physics/2022-08-02-DarkEnergy.markdown %}). However, I still plan to write about the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which, I think, is covered in E1 in HKDSE Physics, maybe a talk on Wien's Displacement Law is also appreciatable, but that requires knowledge in Lambert W Function, and I will have to start talking about Branch Cuts and stuff like that, which is slightly more complicated than I want. However, I think I'll try to write a mild introduction to that topic. 

As a Mathematical Physics Student, I enjoy having math rigor, that's why I enjoy the use of Quantifiers, *i.e.* sentences like:

$$\sim[\forall x, S(x)] \equiv \exists x:[\sim S(x)]$$

Below I'll provide the $$\LaTeX$$ source code:

```bash
$$\sim[\forall x, S(x)] \equiv \exists x:[\sim S(x)]$$
```

Maybe I'll write a bit on Music Also. I am interested in analysing Beethoven Sonatas, and comparing between different interpreters, like the less "conventional" ones, say Glenn Gould 

```bash
Glenn Gould's Beethoven has a Strong Baroque Influence
```

## Polishing Old Content

### Jekyll
This is also something I will do. I feel like my Jekyll documents are generally outdated and some are for Minima Users, which is different from Minimal Mistakes. I have adopted new skills in general and I'm not even using the **_sites** method suggested by [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/), *i.e.* I am actually putting all my original markdown files in GitHub and allow GitHub pages to render it to my website, instead of using:

```bash
Bundle Exec Jekyll Build
```

and pasting the **_sites** content in GitHub. This makes me feel somehow insecure but this is definitely much much faster and is one of the *only?* advantage of Jekyll. 

### LaTeX Documents
My $$\LaTeX$$ files are a bit outdated and I should include interesting content instead of incorrect physics. 


## Reach
As said in various posts, like [my post on partially quitting Instagram]({% link _Journal/2022-09-23-Disgusted.markdown %}), I am very aware that less than 5 people will be viewing this very word. However, this website is **only** for people who want to know deeply about me, and I can see **very few people** falling into this category. So thank you if you are the very few people seeing this very word; or if you are stalking me, thank you for stalking me? 

## Tone and Language
### Tone
My tone here is quite informal? But in Academic Posts I have a much more serious tone (to ensure rigor)

### Language
Two years without typing english means my english proficiency has deteriotated significantly (less than IELTs 8.0), so I'm genuinely sorry if I have made any Grammatical Mistakes here

## Friends
Some of my friends have their own websites, but not many. Maybe that's because I know too any medicine people and they are too busy/don't really care about this, or are somehow intimitated by my nerdiness/by the complexity of Jekyll. Anyhow, anyway, I just think it's easier to maintain a website than social media page (after you have set up everything of course)
