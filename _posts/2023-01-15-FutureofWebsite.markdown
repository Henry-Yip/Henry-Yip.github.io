## Domain Name
Several People, like [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/) have asked me to buy a domain. However, I think [https://henry-yip.github.io/](https://henry-yip.github.io/) is a fabulous name and will lead people to my Github page, which is what I intended from beginning. 

## New Content
I must say I really enjoyed writing my blog post on [HKDSE Physics]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-HKDSE.markdown %})

I will focus more on Physics Content from now on, having attended course related to [Fields, Waves](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxphys08053.htm) and [Matter](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxphys08054.htm), which is heavily related to [HKDSE Physics]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-HKDSE.markdown %})

Despite having written a semi-formal article on [Dark Energy]({% link _Physics/2022-08-02-DarkEnergy.markdown %}), I am not inclining to write any more astrophysics related content, instead focusing on Mathematical Physics, or simply, physics with rigorous math.

Maybe I'll write a bit on Music Also. I am interested in analysing Beethoven Sonatas, and comparing between different interpreters, like the less "conventional" ones, say Glenn Gould 

## Polishing Old Content

### Polishing Grammatical Mistakes
I am re-checking my grammatical accuracy as I am often in a rush writing these essays.

### Jekyll
This is also something I will do. I feel like my Jekyll documents are generally outdated and some are for Minima Users, which is different from Minimal Mistakes. I have adopted new skills in general and I'm not even using the **_sites** method suggested by [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/), *i.e.* I am actually putting all my original markdown files in GitHub and allow GitHub pages to render it to my website, instead of using:

```bash
Bundle Exec Jekyll Build
```

and pasting the **_sites** content in GitHub. This makes me feel somehow insecure but this is definitely much much faster and is one of the *only?* advantage of Jekyll. 

### LaTeX Documents
My $$\LaTeX$$ files are a bit outdated and I should include interesting content instead of incorrect physics. 


## Reach
As said in various posts, like [my post on partially quitting Instagram]({% link _Journal/2022-09-23-Disgusted.markdown %}), I am very aware that less than 5 people will be viewing this very word. However, this website is **only** for people who want to know deeply about me, and I can see **very few people** falling into this category. So thank you if you are the very few people seeing this very word; or if you are stalking me, thank you for stalking me? 

## Tone and Language
### Tone
My tone here is quite informal? But in Academic Posts I have a much more serious tone (to ensure rigor)

### Language
Two years without typing english means my english proficiency has deteriotated significantly (less than IELTs 8.0), so I'm genuinely sorry if I have made any Grammatical Mistakes here

## Friends
Some of my friends have their own websites, but not many. Maybe that's because I know too any medicine people and they are too busy/don't really care about this, or are somehow intimitated by my nerdiness/by the complexity of Html/Javascript/Jekyll/... Anyhow, anyway, I just think it's easier to maintain a website than social media page (after you have set up everything of course)
