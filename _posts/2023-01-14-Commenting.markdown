## Motivation
I enjoy two-sided communication. While I have asked my best friends regarding the depth of my content/asked them to provide general suggestions, I want to know **YOUR** opinion regarding my website so I can obtain a diversity of ideas (because my friends are quite math-heavy and nerdy so what they like won't be what you like).

### Posts People Liked Most:
 - $$LaTeX$$ Tutorials
 - My random rant on how to study Physics
 - Classical Music playlist
 

## Comments
The main feature of [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)/[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is that they allow people to comment on posts. I don't want my website to be inferior to those websites, because I'm trying to prove my point that a Jekyll generated website is what people should endorse. Therefore I allowed reactions and comments. Just scroll below, create an DISQUS account (takes 1 minute) and chat with me! 

```bash
I secretly prefer Wordpress over Wix
```
