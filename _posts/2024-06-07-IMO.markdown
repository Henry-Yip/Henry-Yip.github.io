Here, I am trying to determine all integers $$n > 1$$ such that $$\frac{2^n+1}{n^2}$$ is an integer.

## First Part

Assume $$a \neq 2$$ is the smallest prime that divides $$n$$.

Then, since $$a \vert 2^n+1$$, $$a \vert 2^{2n}-1$$. 

Also, we know that $$a \vert 2^{a-1}-1$$ (Fermat's Little Theorem)

Therefore, $$a \vert 2^{\text{gcd}(2n, \space a-1)}-1$$.

It can be seen that $$\text{gcd}(2n, \space a-1)=2*\text{gcd}(n, \space a-1)=2*1=2$$, hence $$a=3$$. ($$a-1$$ and $$n$$ are coprime and $$a$$ is the smallest prime that divides $$n$$)

Therefore, we can express $$n=(3^x)(y)$$.

## Second Part

To proceed, we shall state the Lifting Exponent Lemma:

For a prime $$p$$, if $$p \mid x+y$$, neither $$x$$ nor $$y$$ is divisible by $$p$$, and $$n$$ is an odd positive integer, then

$$v_p(a^n+b^n)=v_p(n)+v_p(a+b).$$

In our case,

$$v_3(2^n+1)=v_3(n)+v_3(3) = x+1$$

Since $$2^n+1>n^2$$, $$v_3(2^n+1)>v_3(n^2)$$. Hence $$x+1>2x$$.  Hence $$x=1$$. 


## Third Part 

Now let $$q$$ be the smallest prime factor of $$y$$.

Now, 

$$
\begin{align}
q|2^{\text{gcd}(2n,q-1)}-1 &= 2^{2*\text{gcd}(n,q-1)}-1  \\
&=2^6-1 \\
&=63 \\     
&=7*3^2
\end{align}
$$

This gives $$q=7$$, but it is a contradiction, as a power of two can only be congruent to $$1,2,4$$, or $$4$$ modulo $$7$$. 

[$$\text{gcd}(n,q-1)$$ can be $$1$$ or $$3$$, but the case for $$1$$ is rejected also.]

Therefore $$n=3$$ is the only possible solution.

## Exercises for the reader
 - Why is $$a$$ not divisible by $$2$$?
 - Why if $$a \vert 2^n+1$$, then $$a \vert 2^{2n}-1$$. 
 - Why is the conclusion  $$a \vert 2^{\text{gcd}(2n, \space a-1)}-1$$ true?
 - State the Lifting Exponent Lemma and list all the cases. 
 - Show that $$2^n+1>n^2$$.
 - Show that $$\text{gcd}(n,q-1)$$ can be $$1$$ or $$3$$. 
 - Why can't we simply state $$n=3^k$$?
