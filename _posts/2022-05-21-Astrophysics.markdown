# Astrophysics Course Notes

Hi Everyone, this set of notes is made with reference to the Astrophysics Coursebook by The University of Edinburgh. I have gained permission from Professor Catherine Heymans to put my modified notes in my website. 

## Prerequisites
Proficiency in Calculus and Classical Physics, in particular, Newtonian Mechanics.

## Scope
Galaxies and Cosmology, with some coverage on stars.

(There are some minor mistakes in the calculation part...)

# Dark Energy Essay

I spent around 3-4 days writing this short essay, featuring:
 * Introduction to the Cosmic Distance Scale 
 * How Supernova Ia lead to the discovery of Dark Energy
 * Properties of Dark Energy
 * A detour to Einstein's Field Equation (EFE)
 * Consequences of the Dark Energy
 * Timescale of its occurance using precise data

## Side Notes
1. I included these in the "front matter" 
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{apacite}
\usepackage{parskip}
\usepackage[margin=0.8in]{geometry}
\usepackage{url}
\newcommand{\ie}{\textit{i}.\textit{e}. }
\newcommand{\eg}{\textit{e}.\textit{g}. }
```
2. I used mathpix to convert images to $$LaTeX$$. This saved me tons of time
