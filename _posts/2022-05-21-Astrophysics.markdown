## Introduction
Hi Everyone, this set of notes is made with reference to the Astrophysics Coursebook by The University of Edinburgh. I have gained permission from Professor Catherine Heymans to put my modified notes in my website. 

### Prerequisites
Proficiency in Calculus and Classical Physics, in particular, Newtonian Mechanics.

### Scope
Galaxies and Cosmology, with some coverage on stars. 

**If you want a copy of it please consult me directly. I am very willing to show you!**
