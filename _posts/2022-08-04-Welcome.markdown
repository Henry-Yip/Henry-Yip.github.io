# Introduction 
## Myself
[Henry YIP]({% link _Contributors/2022-05-19-Henry.markdown %})


Mathematical Physics Student from the University of Edinburgh
## Before making a website

### LaTeX
Feburary 2022 was when I started to create $$\LaTeX$$ documents. While the process was enjoyable, I was unsatisfied as I lack a platform to host my PDF files (On Quantum Mechanics, Probability).

Inspired by [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/), I was convinced that websites are more sustainable than Social Medias (like Instagram). According to him in [his post about "Why start a website"](https://tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website.html)

```bash
With social media sites, attempts to archive content are probably nightmarish. 
```
which is exactly my experience with Instagram. It is also nightmarish to write serious academic content due to the inability to include $$KaTeX$$. More is explained in my post about [KaTeX]({% link _Chess/2022-12-22-TobyLam.markdown %})

It is also cool to have a personal space where you can customize things, and meanwhile picking up basic html/css skills

## How I learnt to build a website

I am using Jekyll all the way.

If you are asking what Jekyll is or how to download/use it, please check out [My Tutorials]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-19-Jekylltutorial.markdown %}). I spent a huge amount of time on these tutorials so I hope you can at least have a look...

You should probably refer to [My Tutorial on How to Download Jekyll]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-19-JekyllComparision.markdown %}) since there aren't many tutorials online regarding this.


## Why THIS particular website
After sucessfully creating a functional website, I started to think about how I can use this website to create something big. One day, upon the recommendation of Leo Chow, I decided to create a website to teach people physics, but we slowly figured out it is quite impractical unless we know **Manim** (but we both don't). Instead, I thought it would just be great if my friends can write anything on my website without any restrictions (since not everyone know how to make a website).

Therefore, in April 2022, I started asking people around me if they want to write stuff, and surprisingly, almost all of them agreed. 

I would like to thank everyone who is a part of this website. Your presence is definitely noted!

## How I feel about building a website
The process of building websites is painful but enjoyable. I had to learn so many stuff, like how to enable RSS FEED, [How to Change Skins]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-22-JekyllSkins.markdown %}) (in my old website), how to [Include Algolia Search]({% link _Jekyll/2022-06-08-Algolia.markdown %}). Each of these tasks spent me **at least 10 hours**. The solution may seem easy and to be honest, some problems I can't even solve (like resizing images using plugins). 

# Final Touch
As [I'm currently a Year 2 Student]({% link _Contributors/2022-05-19-Henry.markdown %}), I don't have much time to maintain this website. If you want to collaborate with me/have further enquiries please contact me:
