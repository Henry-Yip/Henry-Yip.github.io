# Introduction 
## Myself

My name is Henry Yip. I am a Mathematical Physics Student from the University of Edinburgh. I study the intersection of Mathematics and Physics, focusing on Quantum Physics, General Relativity, and Geometry. 


## Reasons to create a website

### Hosting LaTeX documents online
February 2022 was when I started to create latex documents. While the process was enjoyable, I was unsatisfied as I lacked a platform to host my PDF files (On Quantum Mechanics, Probability).

Inspired by [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/), I was convinced that websites are more sustainable than Social Medias (like Instagram). According to him in [his post about "Why start a website"](https://tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website.html)

```bash
With social media sites, attempts to archive content are probably nightmarish. 
```
which is exactly my experience with Instagram. It is also nightmarish to write serious content due to the inability to include $$\KaTeX$$.

It is also cool to have a personal space where you can customize things, and meanwhile picking up basic html/css skills.


## How I learnt to build a website

I am using Jekyll all the way.

If you are asking what Jekyll is or how to download/use it, please check out [My Tutorials]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-19-Jekylltutorial.markdown %}). I spent a huge amount of time on these tutorials so I hope you can at least have a look...

You should probably refer to [My Tutorial on How to Download Jekyll]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-19-JekyllComparision.markdown %}) since there aren't many tutorials online regarding this.


## Why THIS particular website
After successfully creating a functional website, I imagine creating something big with this website. One day, upon the recommendation of Leo Chow, I decided to create a website to teach people physics, but we slowly figured out it was impractical unless we knew Manim (but we both didn't). Instead, I decided to treat this as a personal website due to the flexibility. Whenever necessary, I can host others' projects/works here if they need a platform.

I am thankful for everyone's encouragement in the creation of this website. 

## How I feel about building a website
The process of building websites is painful but enjoyable. I had to learn so much, like how to enable RSS FEED, [How to Change Skins]({% link _Jekyll/2022-05-22-JekyllSkins.markdown %}) (on my old website), and the method to [Include Algolia Search]({% link _Jekyll/2022-06-08-Algolia.markdown %}). Each of these tasks took me **at least 10 hours**. Despite these, I continue to struggle with many tasks, like resizing images using plugins). 

# Final Touch
As [I'm currently a Year 3 Student]({% link _Contributors/2022-05-19-Henry.markdown %}), I don't have much time to maintain this website. If you want to collaborate with me/have further enquiries please contact me:
