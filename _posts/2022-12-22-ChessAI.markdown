## Chess AI
In the late 1990s, Deep Blue defeated GM Garry Kasparov. You can see the complete news in New York Times: [First Came the Machine That Defeated a Chess Champion](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17deepblue.html)

Most engines, with [Stockfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)) topping the list, have a significantly higher [elo](https://www.chessjournal.com/chess-elo/#:~:text=Elo%20is%20a%20primary%20factor%20used%20in%20Chess,Elo%20system%20is%20Australian%20Chess%20master%2C%20Roger%20Cook.) than [GM Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen), arguably the best Chess Player ever.

Stockfish has an absurdly high elo. You can see this from different websites, like [http://ccrl.chessdom.com](https://ccrl.chessdom.com) . There, [Stockfish, Dragon and Fat Fritz 2 have an elo of over 3500](https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/). Just to let you see the difference, I have included a banner of Live Chess Ratings, provided by [2700chess.com](https://2700chess.com/)

To check the power of chess engines, you can play one [HERE]({% link _Chess/2022-12-24-ChessEngine.markdown %}). You can adjust the difficulty but to be honest, I can't beat the club level difficulty...

Just to be cool, I have installed two chess engines - Fairy-Max and Stockfish in my computer, so they can play around...
