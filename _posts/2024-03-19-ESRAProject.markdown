Liquid behaviour is hard to analyze and usually requires the Navier Stokes equation, which does not have an analytic solution. With reference to a published paper, we attempt to model liquid behaviour in the low velocity limit using two models: Continuous Model and Double Pendulum Model.

## Poster
We gave a presentation on the project in a conference. The poster for the conference is downloadable [HERE]({{site.url}}/assets/ESRAProject.pdf).

## Credits
I would like to thank my groupmates: Patrick Truong, Gregory Barbanel and Abdullah Fouzuddeen for their efforts and contribution. We thank Edinburgh Scientific Researchers Association for their support.
