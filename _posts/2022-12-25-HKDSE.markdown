## Introduction
From HKDSE Physics, we have Centripetal force as $$mr\omega^2$$, or equivalently $$mr \dot{\theta}^2$$ (This is a very special form and only works for circular orbit, as radius is a constant. In General,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{F}=\left(\ddot{r}-r \dot{\theta}^2\right) \hat{r}+(2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}+r \ddot{\theta}) \hat{\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Kepler's Third Law

See [Appendix A]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %}) for the full derivation.
By equating $$mr\omega^2$$ and $$\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$, we can deduce:

$$
T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3
$$

Which is Kepler's third law (in circular motion).

Estimate Peter Griffin's weight:

With $$T=2.75s$$ and $$r=1m$$, we have $$M=7.82 \times 10^{10} \text{kg} $$. Hmmmm

**Proposition**: $$T^2 \propto a^3 \forall $$ ellipses, where a is the semi-major axis

**Proof**:

First Note **Kepler's Second Law**, the rate at which the area is swept by the **Radius Vector** (surprising a constant!)

$$
\dot{A}=\frac{d A}{d t}=\frac{r(r d \theta) / 2}{d t}=\frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}=\frac{h}{2}
$$

Next, by substitution and using the results from [Appendix A]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %})


$$
\Delta t=\frac{A}{\dot{A}}=\frac{\pi a b}{h / 2}=\frac{2 \pi a b}{h}
$$

Next, I'll state the formulae below without proof. Remember that $$\epsilon$$ is defined by us so the below are *almost* definitions

$$
a=\frac{l}{1-\epsilon^2}, \quad b=a \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}=\frac{l}{\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}}
$$

Using $$l=\frac{mh^2}{k}$$, we have:

$$
\Delta t=\frac{2 \pi a b}{h}=\frac{2 \pi}{h} a^2 \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad(\Delta t)^2=\frac{(2 \pi)^2 a^3}{h^2} l=(2 \pi)^2 a^3 \frac{m}{k}
$$

We deduce $$(\Delta t)^2 / a^2=(2 \pi)^2 / G M$$, which is consistent with the analysis from **HKDSE**

## (Angular)Momentum Conservation

From [Appendix B]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %}) , we deduced that
$$r^2 \dot{\theta} \equiv h=\frac{|\underline{L}|}{m}$$, or equivalently $$|\underline{L}|=mr^2 \dot{\theta}$$ Combining the fact that $$v=r\dot{\theta}$$ we have $$|\underline{L}|=mrv$$

Angular Momentum is something you will encounter while skating (or spinning your chair). If you spread your arms and contract your arms, you will realize that you will spin in a different speed, because angular momentum has to be conserved (assumed no friction)

Compared to $$p=mv$$ in HKDSE this rings a bell. However, it is always incorrect to say "angular momentum is converted to linear momentum" because this violates dimensional analysis. More about Dimensional Analysis in [Appendix C]({% link _Physics/2022-12-25-Appendix.markdown %})
