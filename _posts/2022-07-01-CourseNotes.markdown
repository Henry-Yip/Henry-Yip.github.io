This set of notes is made with reference to the Astrophysics Coursebook by The University of Edinburgh. There are many errors and I am not free enough to proofread through it, but please send me corrections if you do find some!


I have gained permission from Professor Catherine Heymans to put my modified notes in my website. 

## Prerequisites
Proficiency in Calculus and Classical Physics, in particular, Newtonian Mechanics.

## Scope
Galaxies and Cosmology, with some coverage on stars.
