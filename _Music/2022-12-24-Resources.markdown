## Motivation
Being a classical music fan, sometimes you want to learn more music theory... And you want to learn it for fun so it won't stress you out. Don't worry, there are tons of Youtube Videos online!

## Youtube Channels

### English Videos
English-Speaking Audiences:

**Richard Atkinson** (**Not** Rowan, aka Mr Bean) has some of the best videos. Below I'll show you some:

### Compositions
Often people imitate composers' styles but their work are usually lacklustre (not that I want to critize them but if everyone does the same it's boring) --- for example, they often use [Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata 1st movement as their template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S75gYhODS0M), and therefore ignoring other interesting "aspects/identies/whatsever  in Beethoven's Music. For example, the presence of some of the more "aggresive" pieces (like Appasionata) are often ignored.

Richter is Good
```

However, **Nahre Sol** is one of the best immitators and composers present in Youtube, truly understanding the intricacies of Beethoven, as well as other composers' styles.

This is just one of the best videos I've ever seen...Authentic and Perfect

```bash
From a Youtube comment:
I really appreciate how you know the compositional styles of everyone and actually make the piece in the style of vs. sticking the tune into the middle of one of the composer’s pieces like a lot of these “in the style of” youtubers do.

From what I recall copyright-free is only specific to certain regions? Not sure...

### Choosing the best recordings

Obviously you can always ask me because I'm quite experienced in this! But there are tons of these types of videos online. An example

### Masterclasses

If you are playing an instrument and you want to know how to sound better/sound more authentic in a specific piece, I recommend you to listen to Masterclasses.

## Concluding Remarks

Obviously the best way to learn *rigorously* is to attend exams... It's the only thing that motivated me... You have no idea how much time I spent in ABRSM Grade 5 Theory. Only while doing actual papers will you understand the topics in a deep enough manner

But I understand that most of you just listen to music for fun, and hey, why be so serious! Relax!
