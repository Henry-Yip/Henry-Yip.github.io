## First Week
Those who know me know I struggled during the semester due to insane workload (Mon to Sun Morning to Night without 1 min of break). I spent the first week just absolutely being lost (waking up at 1pm, going out to eat a meal then sleeping at 4am, eating two cup noodles because I'm hungry at 3am)

## Second Week
Went to [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana_Castle) then [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia), had a fabalous time :) (thanks if you went with me), honestly one of the best memories in 2022 and very possibly in 2023... (:/) 

Have a [New Giraffe toy](https://www.kinder.com/au/en/natoons) from Kinder Egg!

Played [Pok√©mon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go) after a few years of inactivity. Caught a 100iv [chimchar](https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/pokemon/390) and shiny [lapras](https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/pokemon/131) 

## Third Week
Went to London, played tic-tac-toe variant with two people. Raining all day. 

## Fourth Week
Writing this website, depressed bevause uni starts again.
