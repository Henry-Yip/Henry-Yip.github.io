I've realized that most people (all) put their CVs in their personal website. 

Realistically I don't see how potential future employers will stumple upon my website and even if they do, I doubt if this will affect my application procesess. Just like no one ever puts their CVs in their instagram/facebook accounts, right?

The main reason I don't put any personal pictures, however, is because I am terrible at taking pictures. I don't even bother with that.
