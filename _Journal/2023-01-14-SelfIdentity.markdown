## Problem

In the world of **STEM**, self-acceptance is *really* important. **Imposter syndrome** is *really* prevalent and students get **suffocated** seeing the top scorer in the class absolutely crushing everyone and no matter how they study, they can't understand the materials. I have been there, and I believe everyone has been there, except if you are [Terrence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) (or you think you are the next prodigy). 

While everyone has moments of sudden **Eureka**, everyone feels stupid sometimes for missing out the obvious, or just overlooking some really simple facts. 

## Solution

I believe the purpose of studying **STEM** is pure enjoyment. At least, I chose Physics (specifically, **Mathematical Physics**) simply because I want to understand the universe. As long as you like what you are doing, there is no point comparing yourself to others? 

While I *still* emphasize the importance of interacting with smart classmates (simply to learn from their thinking process), never compete with them (after all learning is not about competition) . I've heard my friend saying:

```bash
人比人比死人
```
Comparision with others can cause death!

### Further Thoughts

A chinese quote from <<[神雕俠侶](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Condor_Heroes)>>: 

```bash
｢你說我這是個騙人的玩意，那不錯，武功之中，十成中九成是騙人的玩意兒，只要能把高手騙到，那就是勝了。｣
```
We tend to overrate others and underrate yourself. Ask you friend how they think of you and you may realize you are better than who you think you are!
