I am always convinced by myself that I am a stupid person. I can never follow what the smarter people are discussing in class (so I just nod my head). People oftern regard me higher than they should (by saying I'm as smart as them) and somehow my academic profile (such as coming from SPCC/ grades in year 1 due to dilligence) fake them into thinking I am quick. 

A chinese quote I really like: 

```bash
｢武功之中,十成中九成是騙人玩意兒,只要能把高手騙倒,那就勝了。｣
```

Maybe the smart people aren't that smart after all and all are just trying to intimitate each other.Maybe they **also** think they are inferior to me. 

I used to be good at running but now I can't even move. I used to be good at tropical cyclones but now I don't even have time to do that. People think I have a complete understand of tropical cyclones (maybe I do) but anyone from Earth System Science will know I'm a fluke. I used to be half decent at piano but I have given up. I used to play violin then I can't even enter symphony orchestra in university.

Is there something I've improved on in the past few years? While I agree that I'm a more cautious people (by not losing passports and anything during trips) compared to myself in p6 singapore trip, and I have spent a tremenous amount of time (around 350-400 hours) on this website, nothing much honestly. My understanding of physics is basically laughable and my math can never be as good as math majors.

Or is it just good to uphold my "good" image? So people will feel that I am a smart atheletic person? I have cared too much, maybe I shouldn't!
