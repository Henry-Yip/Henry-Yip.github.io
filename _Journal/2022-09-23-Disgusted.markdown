## Abstract
I am unofficially quitting Instagram on 28/10/2022

## Motivation
IG interactions are fake interactions. Posting stories just for people to "appreciate" your life is pure stupidity (becuase you have to live alone anyways, searching for approval and seeking for competition with others makes your life worse). IG reels are addictive and leaves me with a ridiculously short attention span. I always check if people have read my stories and honestly it has no significance to my life (and I am getting addicted to this!)

I have to learn to embrace loneliness. To start, I have to partially cut contact with everyone
(or at least reduce)

## Alternative
I believe one-way communication is always the best. I don't want to know who read my posts and when (Even though Google Analytics does tell me the location, I don't know your identity)

DMs should be kept as they are in a sense, real communication and it's useful not to cut contact with close frds. However the frequency should never exceed that of real life interactions. Calling is appreciatable (below 1 hr per time!!!) but real in-life interactions should remain dominant

## Concluding Remark
I think I am generally unhappy due to social media. Don't find me mean if I talk with you less online! I am still very happy to help if you want!

And no I didn't block you in IG, don't misunderstand!
