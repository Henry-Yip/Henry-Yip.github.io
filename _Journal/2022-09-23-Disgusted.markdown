## Abstract
I am unofficially quitting Instagram on 28/11/2022 and I will only share update here (therefore check if you want to know more about me!)

## Motivation
I'll quote this from [Toby Lam](https://tobylam.xyz/2022/08/20/audience-tone-of-tobylam.xyz.html):

"I’m aware that the viewership of this website may be very low, yet that doesn’t particularly concern me. I’ve always intended it to be a place where people can know deeply about me if they really wanted to, and I can clearly see that very little people would fall into that category.

And unlike social media platforms, you can catch up on what I’ve written relatively quickly even if you haven’t checked my website in a year or two. I much prefer people spontaneously checking up on it than the artificial timeliness that Instagram or Bereal introduces to foster addiction."

```bash
"I'll only share with people who care!"
```

The other benefit is that I can type longer stuff in this website so I can polish my language skills (which is rapildy declining). Some of my friends write essays as instagram posts but clearly that is inefficient, and no one actually read essays in instagram (it's almost a fast food culture). I hope people can spend a relaxing time here appreciating my nerdiness.

```bash
"The only way for people to read my words is to set up a website"
```

The other thing is that I don't *anyone* to know my personal stuff through Instagram... If it's something important I will tell them in person, if it isn't then they don't need to know.

## Alternatives
Group chats are fun in general. However, I think it's almost undesirable to talk with people I won't meet in a month or so (I mean really lengthy talks). Why connect with people you're never going to to meet in person?

I'm not going to the extremes and use a Nokia Phone, I just think real interactions is the stuff we should embrace. 

```bash
Real life interactions > Online interactions
```

## Concluding Remark
I admit deleting my Instagram is quite an extreme thing to do, but what I think is right is right. I think this will be my stance in the years to come. Don't find me too cold. 
```bash
I am a kind person... According to myself
```
