## Primary
My parents forced me to attend KUMON when I was 5 years old. Being extra prepared before I even enter primary school, I scored top in mathematics and was subsequently invited by my primary school to join the math olympiad team. As primary math olympiad papers were really focused on algebra and me having intensive training in this area resulted in promosing results (some silver medals). 

Maths aside, I struggled in chinese and was quite worried about getting a bad secondary school offer despite decent grades in english and general studies. With a stroke of luck, however, I got top grades in chinese and eventually got an offer from SPCC

## Secondary


I was simply unmotivated to do well in secondary and started to fall behind in F3. My issues in Geometry were never tackled, I failed test after test and scored 46 in further math (M2)

## University

I am trying to do well in university but it's too hard! I suck at Calculus and everything! I can't do this!
