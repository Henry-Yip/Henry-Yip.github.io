I have no idea what is happening to me...

## Introduction
It seems that I am spending too much time in everything, and it's really hard to strike a balance anyways.


Writing a page like this takes me approximately 2-3 hours and since I'm on a plane to Frankfurt right now (It's landing, I have to turn off my computer in a min), it seems to be the only thing I can do (well I have chess installed also but I don't know!)

**Comment on 31/7/2022: **Well Frankfurt is one of my favourite cities - I like Germany in general, mainly because of all the world class orchestra it holds - Speaking of this, I'm listening to the gorgeous [Mahler 4th Symphony by Frankfurt Radio Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wcxLq-D10&t=1015s), conducted by Andr√©s Orozco-Estrada, one of my favourite conductors. And don't forget [Berlin Phil](https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/concerts), it's just simply world class... And the orange chocolate is good --- I like Lufthansa**

## What am I doing now?
I am doing these projects simutaneously:
 - This Website
    - The most difficult stuff is the content instead of the coding (since Jekyll automatically renders markdown into html), but I need to work on the graphics also.

 - Coding
    - I have a book on C++ and I want to solve leetcode problems but I am a bit struggling.

    **Aaaaaaaaaaand I dropped it. I didn't understand Pointers and memory allocation and stuff like this. I think as long as I understand the basic stuff it's already sufficient, so I don't see how it will benefit me in the short run; in the long run tho, I still need C++!**

 - Piano
    - Preparing for diploma, but I can't really find Pianos in Edinburgh (except the one in holland house, but it's so far away from accomodation)

    **Piano is just difficult... I don't really see the point of preparing for Diploma already, maybe I should just play for fun...**

 - Linear Alegbra and some number theory
    - My brain fails to retain stuff learnt in semester 1 (for example Linear Algebra), so I have to have a quick glance; also, as I have 6 courses next semester (including Accelerated Year 2 courses as I skipped School of Math courses in Year 1), I better study more this summer if I want a relaxing life next semester
    **Yes, I looked into some of the stuff... Not all, I still have to add oil**
    {: .notice--warning}
 - Chess 
    - Opening preparation, endgames, puzzle solvings
    **Maybe analysing Chess Olympiad with Stockfish is more fun**

## Conclusion 
It's quite a busy life! But I do get really bored most of the time so getting myself really busy might be a good way out.

```bash
Work hard but don't work too hard
