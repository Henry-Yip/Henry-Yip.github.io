- Starting from Today, i.e. 24/1/2003, I will update my daily (/weekly/monthly) progress in this website. It's more for personal reference, but I hope the general audience can have a glance of what website building is like. 

- I will mainly update on error fixing, as well as problems I can't solve currently. If you think you can help me, please message me:
