## A slight detour -- Mokele-mbembe variation

The content below is heavily based on [this post](https://www.chess.com/blog/ThePawnSlayer/opening-myths-the-mystery-of-the-mokele-mbembe-variation)

### **3...f6**
3...f6 is slightly inferior compared to 3...e6. After 3...f6 white is simply better because the knight on e4 is desparately alone, allowing developmental moves like 4.Bd3.

#### **4...d5**
Seems like the only acceptable move with (+1.8) (depth 24). After that we can try 5.Nc3 which attacks d5. If the opponent takes our knight Qd5# is final nail in the coffin, as the innocent move g6 is met by Bxg6! (! Means Good Move) and black is strictly losing.

#### **4...f5??**
4...f5?? has (+5.9) (depth 24)
The reason is 5. f3 traps the knight. White is also much more developed.

### **3...e6**
3...e6 is slightly inferior compared to 3...f6.
After 4.Bd3 , 4...d5 is again, the best move

5.Nh3! is surprisingly good as 5...Ng5 is no longer available

**DO NOT** play 5.f3 as it loses your rook
