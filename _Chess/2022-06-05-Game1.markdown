I have installed two chess engines -Fairy-Max and Stockfish in my computer so they can play bullet (i.e. 1 min each, no increments)(**I later expanded it to blitz and rapid**). As a chess variation enthuasiast, **I also disabled castling to add more variety (yay!)** (To be honest, I didn't disable... just that somehow the engines choose not to castle xD)

**I have no idea if they disabled en-passant though...**
(Yeah it's confusing, I don't know how the computer works)
Anyways!
**Rapid Game 10 minutes, no increments**

 - **White: Stockfish**
 - **Black: Fairy-Max**

## The Blunder

The Blunder occurs at 14...Nc6??. Black simply forgot that the queen is threatening mate with the knight and bishop and without moving 14...Be7. After several attacks by white, black has to kingwalk to g8 after some very desperate checks, but all was over at that point.
