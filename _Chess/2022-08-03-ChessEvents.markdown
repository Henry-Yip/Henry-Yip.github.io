What a thriller! Hikaru Nakamura just defeated Magnus Carlsen!
According to [chess24](https://new.chess24.com/de/wall/news/nakamura-beats-carlsen-to-win-2022-speed-chess-title#:~:text=The%20rivalry%20between%20Magnus%20Carlsen%20and%20Hikaru%20Nakamura,Magnus%20emerged%20victorious%20by%20the%20narrowest%20possible%20margin.)

"Hikaru Nakamura has now won five Speed Chess titles in a row, but more than that, he’s finally defeated the one player to have beaten him in the format — Magnus Carlsen. Hikaru got off to a stunning 6.5:2.5 start in the 5-minute section, and although Magnus , who said, “I can’t believe how much I enjoyed the match,” took the contest right down to the wire, he ultimately lost 14.5:13.5.

The rivalry between Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura has been intense since the pandemic struck and made chess a serious online sport. Both players referred to the spectacular final of the original Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour, where the players traded blows over seven mini-matches before Magnus emerged victorious by the narrowest possible margin."
