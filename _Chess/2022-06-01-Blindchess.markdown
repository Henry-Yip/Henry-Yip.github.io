Below is a summarization of how I think blind chess should be learnt. I have seen content about these in Youtube and Quora in general.

### Motivation
Mastering Blind Chess requires quite an intensitve training. It's not only cool, but also improves your visualization skills and hence get better in middle games.

### Training Method
 * **Step 1: Master Chess Coordinates**
     - There are **tons** of platforms for this. Check [THIS](https://lichess.org/training/coordinate#find) one for example. Generally aim 20-25 before proceeding to the next step

 *  **Step 2: Try playing some openings in your head**

   - This is so you can still practice within your comfort zone. Try to see if you can go for longer lines, such as those boring lines in Berlin Defence

 *  **Step 3: Move around with pieces**
   - First, think about Bishops, say, what squares can the bishop travel to if it start at f1? What about b6? Or any other squares? Second, try to move around with knight (extremely tricky!) Here are some tips:
      -  Start from the corner! ([inspired by this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4U336yifjg))
        - For example, how to travel from h1 to h2? h1 to g1? 
        - Solutions:
            - h1 -> f2 -> g4 -> h2  
            - h1 -> f2 -> h3 -> g1

      -  Move around the chess board and just see if you can master the movement of the pieces! For example knight f1 to a8? How should we go? Try figure out yourself

      
 *  **Step 4: Play with friends**
     - Try to play with friends, and whenever you are lost about your position, as mentioned above, just check the board again and continue. 

 *  **Step 5: Play random positions**
     - Go to chess puzzles, memorize the position, and try to visualize what's going on while blindfolded. Play classic games, you can find tons in GothamChess

After these, you should be sufficiently proficient in Blind Chess.
