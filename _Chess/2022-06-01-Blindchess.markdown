### Motivation
Mastering Blind Chess requires quite an intensitve training. It's not only cool, but also improves your visualization skills and hence get better in middle games.
### Training Method
 * **Step 1: Master Chess Coordinates**
     - There are **tons** of platforms for this. Check [THIS](https://lichess.org/training/coordinate#find) one for example. Generally aim 20-25 before proceeding to the next step

 *  **Step 2: Try playing some openings in your head**
   - Any opening works! For example Petrov, Alekhine, etc... You name it! (Try my opening series if you haven't) Generally aim for 4/5 steps and when you are stuck, check the position again, memorize the current position and try to continue for 4/5 more steps.

 *  **Step 3: Move around with pieces**
   - First, think about Bishops, say, what squares can the bishop travel to if it start at f1? What about b6? Or any other squares? Second, try to move around with knight (extremely tricky!) Here are some tips:
      - #1 Start from the corner! ([inspired by this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4U336yifjg))
        - For example, how to travel from h1 to h2? h1 to g1? 
        - Solutions:
            - h1 -> f2 -> g4 -> h2  
            - h1 -> f2 -> h3 -> g1

      - #2 Travel to the opposite side of the board
         - For example, g1 to h8?
           - Solution:
           - g1 -> f3 -> g5 -> f7 -> h8   
         - Whenever you are stuck just check back the board and try again! Don't take a huge leap, you will get better over time!  
 *  **Step 4: Play with friends**
     - Try to play with friends, and whenever you are lost about your position, as mentioned above, just check the board again and continue. 
 *  **Step 5: Play random positions**
     - Go to chess puzzles, memorize the position, and try to visualize what's going on while blindfolded. 

After these, you should be sufficiently proficient in Blind Chess.
