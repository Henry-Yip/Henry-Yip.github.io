<p>In the late 1990s, Deep Blue defeated GM Garry Kasparov. You can see the complete news in New York Times: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17deepblue.html">First Came the Machine That Defeated a Chess Champion</a></p>

<p>Most engines, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)">Stockfish</a> topping the list, have a significantly higher <a href="https://www.chessjournal.com/chess-elo/#:~:text=Elo%20is%20a%20primary%20factor%20used%20in%20Chess,Elo%20system%20is%20Australian%20Chess%20master%2C%20Roger%20Cook.">elo</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">GM Magnus Carlsen</a>, arguably the best Chess Player ever.</p>

<p>Stockfish has an absurdly high elo. You can see this from different websites, like <a href="https://ccrl.chessdom.com">http://ccrl.chessdom.com</a> . There, <a href="https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/">Stockfish, Dragon and Fat Fritz 2 have an elo of over 3500</a>. Just to let you see the difference, I have included a banner of Live Chess Ratings, provided by <a href="https://2700chess.com/">2700chess.com</a></p>

<p><a href="https://2700chess.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="https://2700chess.com/files/topten.png" alt="2700chess.com for more details and full list" title="2700chess.com for more details and full list" /></a></p>

<p>To check the power of chess engines, you can play one <a href="/Chess/Events/">HERE</a>. You can adjust the difficulty but to be honest, I can’t beat the club level difficulty…</p>

<p>Just to be cool, I have installed two chess engines - Fairy-Max and Stockfish in my computer, so they can play around…</p>

<h2 id="before-making-a-website">Before making a website</h2>

<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>
<p>Feburary 2022 was when I started to create \(LaTeX\) documents. While the process was enjoyable, I was unsatisfied as I lack a platform to host my PDF files (On Quantum Mechanics, Probability).</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://tobylam.xyz/">Toby Lam</a>, I was convinced that websites are more sustainable than Social Medias (like Instagram). According to him in <a href="https://tobylam.xyz/2020/08/11/why-start-a-website.html">his post about “Why start a website”</a></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>With social media sites, attempts to archive content are probably nightmarish. 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which is exactly my experience with Instagram. It is also nightmarish to write serious academic content due to the inability to include \(KaTeX\). More is explained in my post about <a href="/Chess/TobyLam/">KaTeX</a></p>

<p>It is also cool to have a personal space where you can customize things, and meanwhile picking up basic html/css skills</p>

<h2 id="how-i-learnt-to-build-a-website">How I learnt to build a website</h2>

<p>I am using Jekyll all the way.</p>

<p>If you are asking what Jekyll is or how to download/use it, please check out <a href="/Jekyll/tutorials/">My Tutorials</a>. I spent a huge amount of time on these tutorials so I hope you can at least have a look…</p>

<p>You should probably refer to <a href="/Jekyll/UsingJekyll/">My Tutorial on How to Download Jekyll</a> since there aren’t many tutorials online regarding this.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-particular-website">Why THIS particular website</h2>
<p>After sucessfully creating a functional website, I started to think about how I can use this website to create something big. One day, upon the recommendation of <a href="/Contributors/LeoChow/">Leo Chow</a>, I decided to create a website to teach people physics, but we slowly figured out it is quite impractical unless we know <strong>Manim</strong> (but we both don’t). Instead, I thought it would just be great if my friends can write anything on my website without any restrictions (since not everyone know how to make a website).</p>

<p>Therefore, in April 2022, I started asking people around me if they want to write stuff, and surprisingly, almost all of them agreed.</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone who is a part of this website. Your presence is definitely noted!</p>

<h2 id="how-i-feel-about-building-a-website">How I feel about building a website</h2>
<p>The process of building websites is painful but enjoyable. I had to learn so many stuff, like how to enable RSS FEED, <a href="/Jekyll/skins/">How to Change Skins</a> (in my old website), how to <a href="/Jekyll/Algolia/">Include Algolia Search</a>. Each of these tasks spent me <strong>at least 10 hours</strong>. The solution may seem easy and to be honest, some problems I can’t even solve (like resizing images using plugins).</p>

<h1 id="final-touch">Final Touch</h1>
<p>As <a href="/Contributors/HenryYip/">I’m currently a Year 2 Student</a>, I don’t have much time to maintain this website. If you want to collaborate with me/have further enquiries please contact me:</p>
