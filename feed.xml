<p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17deepblue.html">Deep Blue defeated GM Garry Kasparov</a>, it seems that AI are unbeatable… Most engines, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)">Stockfish</a> topping the list, have a significantly higher <a href="https://www.chessjournal.com/chess-elo/#:~:text=Elo%20is%20a%20primary%20factor%20used%20in%20Chess,Elo%20system%20is%20Australian%20Chess%20master%2C%20Roger%20Cook.">elo</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">GM Magnus Carlsen</a>, arguably the best Chess Player ever.</p>

<p><a href="(https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/)">Stockfish has an elo of around 3500</a>. Just to let you see the difference…</p>

<p>To check the power of chess engines, you can play one <a href="/Chess/Events/">HERE</a></p>

<p>I have installed two chess engines - Fairy-Max and Stockfish in my computer, so they can play around…</p>

<p>I have no idea why they didn’t castle… Maybe it’s an error on my part…</p>

<h2 id="before-making-a-website">Before making a website</h2>
<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>
<p>In February, I began learning \(\LaTeX\) and created tons of math documents. While it was fun, I didn’t really have a platform to put all these documents so it was kinda pointless. 
(I created some documents on Quantum Mechanics and some basic math. (It looks quite bad, but hey it was my 3rd day doing \(\LaTeX\), so I was quite glad it worked somehow)</p>

<h2 id="how-i-learnt-to-build-a-website">How I learnt to build a website</h2>
<p>In March, I decided that creating a website is probably beneficial to me, and since my friend used Jekyll, I began looking into it.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">If you are asking what Jekyll is or how to download/use it, please check out <a href="/Jekyll/tutorials/">My Tutorials</a>. I spent a huge amount of time on these tutorials so I hope you can at least have a look…</p>

<p>As I didn’t have previous experience, it was a complete disaster as I spent almost 2 days downloading all the necessary stuff (If you want to use Jekyll there are tons of stuff you should download.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">You should probably refer to <a href="/Jekyll/UsingJekyll/">My Tutorial on How to Download Jekyll</a></p>

<h2 id="why-this-particular-website">Why THIS particular website</h2>
<p>After sucessfully creating a functional website, I started to think about how I can use this website to create something big. One day, upon the recommendation of <a href="/Contributors/LeoChow/">Leo Chow</a>, I decided to create a website to teach people physics, but we slowly figured out it is quite impractical unless we know <strong>Manim</strong> (but we both don’t). Instead, I thought it would just be great if my friends can write anything on my website without any restrictions (since not everyone know how to make a website) I started asking people around me , and surprisingly, almost all of them agreed. (Special thanks to all my contributors, especially <a href="/Contributors/LeoChow/">Leo Chow</a> for all their supportive work). And after a month or so, two of my classmates from spcc asked if I can create a <strong>STEM project</strong> with them, so now I’m sorta co-leading the website design of two projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-feel-about-building-a-website">How I feel about building a website</h2>
<p>The process of building websites is <strong>JUST PAINFUL</strong>. I had to learn so many stuff. Like how to enable RSS FEED, <a href="/Jekyll/skins/">How to Change Skins</a> (in my old website), how to <a href="/Jekyll/Algolia/">Include Algolia Search</a>. Each of these tasks spent me <strong>at least 10 hours</strong>. The solution may seem easy and to be honest, some problems I can’t even solve (like resizing images using plugins).</p>

<h1 id="final-touch">Final Touch</h1>
<p>As <a href="/Contributors/HenryYip/">I’m currently a Year 2 Student</a>, I don’t have much time to maintain this website. If you want to collaborate with me/have further enquiries please contact me:</p>
