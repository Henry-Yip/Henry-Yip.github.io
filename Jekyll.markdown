## Introduction
My website is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). It is largely based on [Toby Lam's Method](https://tobylam.xyz/2022/12/21/elements-of-tobylam.xyz.html). Note that he uses **Minima** while I use **Minimal Mistakes**, so it's slightly different. I am writing all these using [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), in [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
